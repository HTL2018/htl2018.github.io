[Sine Resistance Network-Based Motion Planning Approach for Autonomous Electric Vehicles in Dynamic Environments](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9714284)

published in IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification

**Tenglong Huang**, Huihui Pan\*, Weichao Sun, Huijun Gao\*

[**Main Contributions:**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9714284) 
- A new sine grid is presented for the first time to construct a novel sine resistance network (SRN). The proposed novel sine grid can avoid curvature discontinuity. Thus, the path smoothness and overall performance are improved significantly.
- The bias oval artificial potential field (BOAPF) is generated by taking the velocity information into account. The modified APF method can cope with the dynamic environment.

[Approximation-Free Prespecified Time Bionic Reliable Control for Vehicle Suspension](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246850)

published in IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering

**Tenglong Huang**, Jue Wang, Huihui Pan\*

[**Main Contributions:**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246850) 
- A pre-specified time controller is designed that can make the steady-state responses of error signals converge to a neighborhood of 0 over a pre-specified finite time interval. 
- By introducing time delay information, the designed control scheme is model-free and approximation-free. Actuator faults can be effectively compensated and handled to enhance reliability. 
- Inspired by animal bionic structures, asymmetric X-type bio-inspired dynamics are embedded into this controller, which further reduces energy consumption.

[Finite-Time Fault-Tolerant Integrated Motion Control for Autonomous Vehicles With Prescribed Performance](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9999451)

published in IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification

**Tenglong Huang**, Jue Wang, Huihui Pan\*, Weichao Sun

[**Main Contributions:**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9999451) 
- A fixed-time integrated motion control scheme with time-varying longitudinal velocity is presented to address the interactions and coupling between lateral and longitudinal dynamics. 
- The desired trajectory and dynamics can be tracked accurately. The tracking errors can enter the prescribed steady-state precision region in a fixed time, and asymptotic convergence is ensured. 
- The negative impacts of the unknown external disturbance and actuator faults are eliminated. Note that no additional boundness information and approximate tools are required.

[Adaptive Bioinspired Preview Suspension Control With Constrained Velocity Planning for Autonomous Vehicles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10120925)

published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles

**Tenglong Huang**, Jue Wang, Huihui Pan\*

[**Main Contributions:**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10120925) 
- A constrained velocity planning algorithm is proposed to balance the vertical ride comfort, longitudinal comfort, and passage time. 
- Based on the planned velocity and road information, this article presents a preview controller employing generated road excitation from an adaptive control perspective. 
- To the authors‚Äô knowledge, this study is the first to propose a nonlinear adaptive bionic preview suspension control and planning framework. 
- Animal limb-inspired bio-inspired dynamics are introduced as reference trajectories to take advantage of the beneficial nonlinearities, achieving significant energy savings.
