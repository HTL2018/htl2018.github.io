**Tenglong Huang (ÈªÑËÖæÈæô)** received Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Huijun Gao](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=2DdpHLEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) (Â∏à‰ªé[È´ò‰ºöÂÜõÊïôÊéà](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/gaohuijun)). A member of IEEE, Chinese Society of Automation, and Chinese Society of Artificial Intelligence. Meanwhile, I am an active reviewer of IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, Applied Intelligence, Robotics (Êú∫Âô®‰∫∫), Information and Control (‰ø°ÊÅØ‰∏éÊéßÂà∂), and other journals. I am also a reviewer, Technical Program Committee, or Workshop Chair of IECON, CVCI, China Automation Conference, ICRAIC, and other conferences.

My research interest includes intelligent vehicles, mobile robots, robotic manipulators, intelligent agriculture, and related research topics on nonlinear control, intelligent control, motion planning, fault-tolerant control, etc. 

If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [huangtenglong@hotmail.com]().

[Sine Resistance Network-Based Motion Planning Approach for Autonomous Electric Vehicles in Dynamic Environments](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9714284)

published in IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification

**Tenglong Huang**, Huihui Pan\*, Weichao Sun, Huijun Gao\*

[**Main Contributions:**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9714284) 
- A new sine grid is presented for the first time to construct a novel sine resistance network (SRN). The proposed novel sine grid can avoid curvature discontinuity. Thus, the path smoothness and overall performance are improved significantly.
- The bias oval artificial potential field (BOAPF) is generated by taking the velocity information into account. The modified APF method can cope with the dynamic environment.
